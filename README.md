# Snake-Water-Gun Game

Welcome to the Snake-Water-Gun game repository! This project features three distinct implementations of the classic Snake-Water-Gun game. Each version demonstrates a different approach to coding this simple yet engaging game.

## Versions

### Version 1: Basic Implementation

A straightforward implementation using traditional conditional statements to determine the winner. This version is easy to understand and ideal for beginners.

### Version 2: Functional Programming Approach

This version leverages functional programming concepts, such as `map`, `filter`, and `lambda` functions, to determine the game outcome. It showcases a more concise and elegant approach to game logic.

### Version 3: Advanced Implementation with Data Structures

An advanced version that incorporates complex data structures and algorithms to handle the game logic. This implementation demonstrates a more robust approach to managing game state and determining the winner.
